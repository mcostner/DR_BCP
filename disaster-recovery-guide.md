# Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plan for SMBs

This guide outlines a practical framework for small to mid-sized businesses to develop a Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity Plan (BCP). The goal is to ensure essential operations can be maintained or quickly restored during and after an unexpected event.

## 1. Objective

To minimize operational disruptions and financial loss due to unplanned outages, data loss, cyberattacks, natural disasters, or other business-impacting events.

## 2. Scope

This plan applies to all business-critical systems, data, and personnel. It includes guidelines for response, recovery, and continuity efforts across IT infrastructure, communications, and operations.

## 3. Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

Conduct a business impact analysis to determine:

- Which systems and services are critical to daily operations
- The maximum acceptable downtime (Recovery Time Objective or RTO)
- The maximum acceptable data loss (Recovery Point Objective or RPO)
- The financial and operational impact of interruptions

## 4. Risk Assessment

Identify potential threats such as:

- Cyberattacks
- Power outages
- Hardware failure
- Natural disasters
- Insider threats

Evaluate the likelihood and potential impact of each threat to prioritize response strategies.

## 5. Data Backup Strategy

- Maintain at least three copies of important data, stored on two different types of media, with one copy offsite or in the cloud (3-2-1 rule)
- Automate backups and verify completion daily
- Test restore procedures regularly to ensure data integrity

## 6. Critical System Recovery

Document procedures to restore:

- File servers and databases
- Email and communication systems
- Customer-facing services (e.g., websites or portals)
- Workstations and user access

Include clear steps, required tools, recovery credentials (secured), and responsible personnel.

## 7. Communication Plan

- Establish a clear chain of command and contact list for employees, vendors, and stakeholders
- Prepare message templates for notifying staff, customers, and partners
- Use multiple channels such as email, SMS, phone, or cloud-based alert systems

## 8. Alternate Work Locations and Remote Access

- Identify alternate work sites or enable secure remote work options
- Ensure VPN or cloud-based access to critical systems is available and tested

## 9. Disaster Recovery Roles and Responsibilities

Define who is responsible for:

- Initiating the DR plan
- System recovery
- Internal and external communications
- Coordination with vendors and service providers
- Documentation of the incident and actions taken

## 10. Plan Testing and Maintenance

- Conduct tabletop exercises and full DR simulations at least annually
- Update the plan whenever systems, personnel, or procedures change
- Review results and lessons learned after each test or real incident

## 11. Compliance and Documentation

- Ensure the DR/BCP aligns with relevant regulations or standards such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, or ISO 27001
- Store the plan in secure and accessible locations, both online and offline
- Maintain version control and access logs for plan modifications

## 12. Appendix (Optional)

Include supporting documentation such as:

- System recovery runbooks
- Contact lists
- Vendor support agreements
- Backup schedules and logs
- Change management procedures

This plan serves as a foundation for building a more detailed, tested, and resilient disaster recovery and business continuity strategy as your organization grows.
